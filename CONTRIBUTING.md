For problems or enhancements (be it packs or script), feel free to make an issue or even a PR.

PR's should ideally be rebased on the current state of master.

Please sort the cards you edited alphabetically by using `deck.py edit -a packs/the-pack.json`.

## Writing Tips

There's only one absolutely mandatory thing: Black cards must have as many blank characters (`_`) as it takes white cards to answer it.

Otherwise feel free to write your cards however you want, but here are some tips I found quite useful to ensure at least a basic level of quality for packs.

### Ratio
Looking at the "Cards Against Humanity" base pack, a ratio for black to white cards of at least 1:5 should work well. Having more white cards is even better, of course, but going below a ratio of 1:4 might make the pack wear itself off too rapidly.

### Articles
From my experience, keeping articles ("a", "my", "the", etc.) in the white and not in the black cards makes the latter way more susceptible for all kinds of answers and thus enables more combinations. This doesn't have to apply to every black card, of course.

### -ing
Verbs or actions work well in the "-ing" form. This way they can also be interpreted as a noun and fit in more cards. E.g. "boiling water" can be read as "the act of making water boil" as well as "water that is boiling".

### Adjectives and Adverbs
Adjectives tend to work only with rather few kinds of prompts. Having too many adjective cards will "flood" the hands with unuseful responses. I'd recommend to have only a small number of them in the deck (maybe like 1 or 2 in 100?), so that if they fit, they hit extra well the additional advantage of breaking the grammatical expectation.

### Leading into the blank
Sometimes the magic lies in the way the blank is embedded in the black card. Using or avoiding some grammatical constructions can make a black card more or less susceptible for white cards. Try for example the following variations of the same prompt with a handful of the same white cards of different kinds:

    My wife is still mad at me _.
    My wife is still mad at me for _.
    My wife is still mad at me about _.
    My wife is still mad because I had _.
    My wife is still mad because I was _.
    My wife is still mad because of _.

But, of course, don't use one form or the other too excessively or the cards will all sound too similar and make the game a little dull.
