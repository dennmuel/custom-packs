# Schakal Edition
Handcrafted, homemade, unthemed random deck for "Cards Against Humanity" / "AllBadCards".

## TODO
- Create script to insert cards, automatically sort the json file and update the numbers
- Make a website for "Bachmannaids" (or remove the card)
- Keep testing gameplay and remove weak elements
- Re-add duplicates to official CAH packs (since official packs were removed from ABC)?
- Add ABC deck code
